# Lab Chapter-07

## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to master vi commands and shell scripts

## Outcomes

At the end you will have mastered the basics of vi and now be proficient in the tools of Linux shell scripting

### Prerequisites

* You will need an additional virtual machine with Ubuntu Server 22.04 installed for this entire lab
* You will need to make sure the `vim` program is installed
* You will need to clone/pull the Textbook source code to the Ubuntu Server virtual machine in the home directory
* You will need to install the program ```vimtutor```
  * On Ubuntu by typing ```sudo apt-get install vim vim-runtime vim-gtk```
  * On Fedora by typing ```sudo dnf install vim vim-enhanced```
  * There is a good text explanation of each of the vim tutor exercises: [https://www.systutorials.com/vim-tutorial-beginners-vimtutor/](https://www.systutorials.com/vim-tutorial-beginners-vimtutor/ "vimtutor exercises")

#### Part 1

1) Using Ubuntu or Fedora Desktop, type the command ```vimtutor``` from the terminal. __Warning:__ ```vimtutor``` requires you to read the instructions carefully!
    i) This is a 6 part tutorial. You need to follow all the steps of the 6 part tutorial making your changes directly in the file.
    i) __Be careful__ to save the file to an external location â€“ otherwise IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN each time you launch the vimtutor command. You can do this by typing ```:w  ~/Documents/vimtutor.txt``` - this way you can edit the file on your local system instead of launching the vimtutor application again. Note you need to use ```vim``` for this assignment.
    i) Save the finished output of `vimtutor.txt` in `vim` using the `:w` command

    [vimtutor.txt](./vimtutor.txt)

#### Part 2

1) On Ubuntu Server from the textbook source code folder: ```files/Chapter-07/lab```, copy the file ```install-software.sh```to your home directory
    i) Using vim/ex commands, find all occurrences of ```python``` and replace them with ```python3```
    i) Save file and quit the vim editor
    i)  To test your work, give the shell script execute permission and execute it by using `sudo ./install-software.sh`
    i) Take a screenshot of the result

#### Part 3

1) Using Ubuntu Server, in your home directory, using vim, create a shell script named ```first-shell.sh``` in your home directory that contains the following:
    i) Add the proper *shebang* on the first line.
    i) Add two lines of space
    i) Store the output of the command ```date``` into the shell variable named **DT**
    i) Add the command that will print out the text: "#############"
    i) Add the command that will print out the text: "Shell successfully execute at: $DT"
    i) Add the command that will print out the text: "#############"
    i) Save the file and quit the vim editor
    i) Execute the command to give first-shell.sh execute permission
    i) Take a screenshot of the output executing first-shell.sh
    i) Take a screenshot of the command used to print the content of the file: first-shell.sh

1) Using vim:
    i) Create a shell script named **install-textbook-dependencies.sh** in your home directory.
    i) Add the proper *shebang* on the first line, then two lines of space
    i) Type the lines below into your shell script
    i) Edit Line 3 of chapter-01.md to add your name nest to mine
    i) Give the script execute permission and execute it
    i) To test the results, `cd` into the Linux-Text-Book-Part-1 directory (clone it if you have not) and execute the the script: `./build-linux-and-macos.sh` (the script should already have execute permission)

    i) To test if the textbook built correctly - cd into the directory: **output/pdf**.  Issue the `ls` command and you will see two PDF files. Open one to Chapter 01 to see your name.

#### Part 4

1) In Ubunut Server, using the `sudo mv` command, move your shell-script: `first-shell.sh` to `/usr/local/bin`.  Exeecute the command `first-shell.sh` and take a screenshot of all the previous commands and output

 ![*end*](./images/part4.1.jpg "end")

1) In Ubunut Server, inside the Textbook sample code > files > Chaper-07 > logs > u_ex151002.log write a `grep` command to find each line that has `*.php` in it

grep '\.php' /files/Chapter-07/logs/u_ex151002.log

 ![*end*](./images/part4.2.1.jpg "end")


  i) Pipe the output of that command to another grep command to find all the lines that have `.php` and NOT `xmlrpc.php`

grep '\.php' /files/Chapter-07/logs/u_ex151002.log | grep -v 'xmlrpc.php'
