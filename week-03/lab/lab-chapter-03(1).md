# Chapter 03 Labs

You will need to do some research and find the download links for the Linux and BSD based distros below and install them in VirtualBox. You will need to install the latest version of [VirtualBox 7.x](https://virtualbox.org "VirtualBox Download site") in order to complete this exercise; it can be installed via Chocolatey or Brew package managers as well. If you are using an M1 Mac, you will need to purchase a copy of a comparable software called [Parallels Virtualization for M1 Macs](https://www.parallels.com/ "Parallels virtualization for M1 Mac").

Complete each install to disk--there should NOT be an INSTALL ICON on the desktop -- your screenshot is taken after a complete install is finished and a reboot has taken place. Assume each instance listed below is 64-bit version. Take a screen shot of each desktop after logging in. There are 20 different distributions listed. If a version number is not listed, assume the latest version unless noted.
