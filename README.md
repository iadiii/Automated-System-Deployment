# **Automated Systems Deployment and Management**
üöÄ **Mastering Enterprise-Grade Virtualized Environments Using Open Source Tools**

## üìå **Project Overview**
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of an **automated system deployment and management** framework built using **Packer, Vagrant, and shell scripting** to provision, configure, and manage a scalable **virtualized server infrastructure**.

The project was developed as part of **ITMO 556 - Introduction to Open Source Software**, focusing on **enterprise-grade automation**, **infrastructure as code (IaC)**, and **system administration best practices** in a multi-distribution Linux environment.
