# Chapter 02 - Podcast Questions

This week we have an article written in place of an Audio Podcast: [IBM, Red Hat and Free Software: An old maddogâ€™s view - Linux Professional Institute (lpi.org)](https://www.lpi.org/blog/2023/07/30/ibm-red-hat-and-free-software-an-old-maddogs-view/ "interview with maddog hall") with [John Maddog Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hall_(programmer) "wiki article of John Hall")

* Who is John Maddog Hall and when did he start to program?
  * John Maddog Hall is a computer scientist and a software developer. He is involved in the field for many years. He started programming in 1969. He used the FORTRAN programming language and punched cards to create his programs. 
* Briefly explain the difference between using gratis software and Free or Freedom Respecting Softare.
  * Gratis software is a type of free software, which is available to download and use free of cost. It comes with its own limitations. They may not be available to modify, share or redesistribute the software's source code. On the otherhand Free or Freedom Respecting Software as the name suggests are totally free of cost and have no limitations for any distribution, modfification or sharing.
* Under the header: "Why would companies pay to use RHEL?" - Briefly explain the reasoning why companies will pay money to use opensource software.
  * Because open-source software like RHEL offers the dependability, support, security, and scalability required for their mission-critical operations, businesses are prepared to pay for it. Although open-source software is available for free, businesses understand the benefit of spending money on solutions that are properly supported to guarantee reliable and unbroken IT operations.
* Who is Maddog calling "Free Loaders" and why is he calling them this?
  *  "Freeloaders" refers to people or groups who use open-source software without actively giving back to the community or honoring contracts established with vendors. Maddog is calling this to the people who use clones of the various distribution and then do not give back to the communuity in any way, shape or form.
* Breifly explain why or why you do not agree with his conclusion stated in "Tying it all together"
  * I agree with the conclusion in "Tying it all together" because IBM and Red Hat's Business model helps sustain the development of high-quality enterprise grade software, ensuring long-term viability. Also it is fair that organizations using RHEL in their business operations should contribute back in some way, either by purchasing licenses or by participating in the open-source community.
