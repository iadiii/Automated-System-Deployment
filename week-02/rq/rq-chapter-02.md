* Based on the movie's tone and rhetoric - why do you think there was an anti-Microsoft tone at the time of the movies making (~2001)? (You may need to research [Microsoft anti-trust case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp. "Anti-Trust") ).
  * This movie was released at a time when there was an anti Microsoft sentiment in the open source and free software industry.
  The open source and free software industry was concerned about the monopoly and dominance and anti competitive practices by Microsoft and its products. Moreover, the whole point of open source software and free software is that the source code be availbe to users and developers to modify etc. But Microsoft's source code was kept a secret, which was against the guidelines of community. The legal battles of Microsoft, including the popularly known Anti Trust Case, made a perception that Microsoft was using its market power and resources in ways that would harm the competition.
* When Bill Gates wrote his 1976 *"Open Letter to Hobbyists"*, was he justified in his complaint? Why or why not?
  * Personally for me, Bill Gates with his own concerns of investing his time and money in his products to make profit for his company is not a crime. Everyone has their own right to make money in a good way and there is nothing wrong in getting a reward for investing their own time and efforts to make a product.

* Why did Bruce Perens help write the Open Source Definition / Debian Social Contract Standard?
  * Bruce Perens was a strong advocate for the open-source software movement. He believed that open source software offered significant benefits in terms of collaboration, innovation, and freedom. He wanted to promote the idea that software should be open for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. He along with others in the open-source community, recognized the need for a clear and concise definition that would distinguish open source from proprietary software. By helping to write Open Source Definition/Debian Social Contract Standard he made a few set of criterias and principle that could be used to evaluate if the software was truly open source.

  The VA Linux's price today (The Geeknet stock price) is around $19-20. On its opening day though it created a history to open at $30, trade till almost $300 and close at $239.
* According to Eric S. Raymond what was the major application that needed to "flip" for opensource to become a viable enterprise solution?
  * Eric S. Raymond believed that the major application that needed to "flip" to open source to make it a viable enterprise solution was the web server software. The software used to serve web pages and other content to users is a crucial part of the internet's infrastructure. Making web server software open source made it possible for companies and organizations to deploy dependable, scalable web servers at a cheaper cost, which played a big role in the enterprise's widespread acceptance of open source solutions.

He recognizes Linux's contribution to the growth of open source and open standards in the software sector. The GNU Project, which he established and which contributed numerous crucial tools and components for Linux distributions, is not always given equal recognition or credit, which causes him some disappointment.
* What is the main difference between *"Free Software"* and *"Open Source Software"*?
  * Free software emphasizes the importance of freedom, not just access to source code. It emphasizes software freedom as a matter of ethics and social responsibility.
